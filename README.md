# unit13-challenge
The power of the cloud and Unsupervised Learning

## Background

> In this project, we will accomplish the following main tasks:

- **Initial Robo Advisor Configuration**: Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements
 to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

- **Build and Test the Robo Advisor** : Make sure that the bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user,
 by building and testing it.

- **Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function**: Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns
 the investment portfolio recommendation. This task includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.

## Steps

### Initial Robo Advisor Configuration

## Submission

- The Robo Advisor bot was exported and saved as zip file **RoboAdvisor_BOT**.

- The Robo Advisor bot is built on the RecommendPortfolio intent which was exported and saved as zip file RecommendPortfolio_INTENT.

- The riskLevel slot was created within the RecommedPortfolio intent to accept the investorâ€™s risk tolerance level. It was exported and 
saved as zip file riskLevel_SLOT.

- The Robo Advisor is enhanced with recommendPorftolio Amazon Lambda function which was saved as Python file robo_advisor.py. 
The same function was also saved in Jupyter Notebook file robo_advisor.ipynb.


- The recommendPortfolio function was tested using the test cases contained in the folder Taste Cases.

- The Bot performance was recorded using MAC QuickTime Player

- Although the icons are available with public access, but the images were broken
